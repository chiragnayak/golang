basics:
=======

go build : compiles a bunch of go source code files
go run   : compiles and executes one or two files
go fmt   : formats all code in each file in current directory
go install : compiles and "installs" a package
go get   : Downloads raw source code of someone else's package
go test  : runs any tests associated with the current project



package : 
==========
+ a project or workspace
+ collection of comon source ocode files.
+ can have many related files.
+ all files ends with .go
+ all files must declare the package it belongs to

Types of packages:
=================

- executable
 + generates a file we can run
 + specifically word "main" is used to create executable type package
 (when we run main.exe that is generated after executing "go build", function named "main" would be automatically run)
 + package "main" must have a function by name "main"
 + 

- resuable
 + code used as helpers 
 + good place to keep reusable logic
 + package creates with any other name apart from "main" creates a re-usable package
 +
